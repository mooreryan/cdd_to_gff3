Q#1 - >YP_006488773[]	superfamily	351832	456	769	5.82377e-87	279.704	cl02626	DNA_pol_A superfamily	 - 	 - 	Family A polymerase primarily fills DNA gaps that arise during DNA repair, recombination and replication; DNA polymerase family A, 5'-3' polymerase domain. Family A polymerase functions primarily to fill DNA gaps that arise during DNA repair, recombination and replication. DNA-dependent DNA polymerases can be classified into six main groups based upon phylogenetic relationships with E. coli polymerase I (classA), E. coli polymerase II (class B), E.coli polymerase III (class C), euryarchaeota polymerase II (class D), human polymerase  beta (class X), E. coli UmuC/DinB and eukaryotic RAP 30/Xeroderma pigmentosum variant (class Y). Family A polymerases are found primarily in organisms related to prokaryotes and include prokaryotic DNA polymerase I, mitochondrial polymerase gamma, and several bacteriophage polymerases including those from odd-numbered phage (T3, T5, and T7). Prokaryotic polymerase I (pol I) has two functional domains located on the same polypeptide; a 5'-3' polymerase and a 5'-3' exonuclease. Pol I uses its 5' nuclease activity to remove the ribonucleotide portion of newly synthesized Okazaki fragments and the DNA polymerase activity to fill in the resulting gap. The structure of these polymerases resembles in overall morphology a cupped human right hand, with fingers (which bind an incoming nucleotide and interact with the single-stranded template), palm (which harbors the catalytic amino acid residues and also binds an incoming dNTP) and thumb (which binds double-stranded DNA) subdomains.

DNA-dependent DNA polymerases can be classified in six main groups based upon phylogenetic relationships with E. coli polymerase I (classA), E. coli polymerase II (class B), E.coli polymerase III (class C), euryarchaaeota polymerase II (class D), human polymerase  beta (class x), E. coli UmuC/DinB and eukaryotic RAP 30/Xeroderma pigmentosum variant (class Y). Family A polymerase are found primarily in organisms related to prokaryotes and include prokaryotic DNA polymerase I (pol I) ,mitochondrial polymerase delta, and several bacteriphage polymerases including those from odd-numbered phage (T3, T5, and T7). Prokaryotic Pol Is have two functional domains located on the same polypeptide; a 5'-3' polymerase and 5'-3' exonuclease. Pol I uses its 5' nuclease activity to remove the ribonucleotide portion of newly synthesized Okazaki fragments and DNA polymerase activity to fill in the resulting gap. A combination of phylogenomic and signature sequence-based (or phonetic) approaches is used to understand the evolutionary relationships among bacteria. DNA polymerase I is one of the conserved proteins that is used to search for protein signatures. The structure of these polymerases resembles in overall morphology a cupped human right hand, with fingers (which bind an incoming nucleotide and interact with the single-stranded template), palm (which harbors the catalytic amino acid residues and also binds an incoming dNTP) and thumb (which binds double-stranded DNA) subdomains.

DNA-dependent DNA polymerases can be classified in six main groups based upon phylogenetic relationships with E. coli polymerase I (classA), E. coli polymerase II (class B), E.coli polymerase III (class C), euryarchaaeota polymerase II (class D), human polymerase  beta (class x), E. coli UmuC/DinB and eukaryotic RAP 30/Xeroderma pigmentosum variant (class Y). Family A polymerase functions primarily to fill DNA gaps that arise during DNA repair, recombination and replication. Pol theta is an exception among family A polymerases and generates processive single base substitutions. Family A polymerase are found primarily in organisms related to prokaryotes and include prokaryotic DNA polymerase I (pol I) ,mitochondrial polymerase delta, and several bacteriphage polymerases including those from odd-numbered phage (T3, T5, and T7). Prokaryotic Pol Is have two functional domains located on the same polypeptide; a 5'-3' polymerase and 5'-3' exonuclease. Pol I uses its 5' nuclease activity to remove the ribonucleotide portion of newly synthesized Okazaki fragments and DNA polymerase activity to fill in the resulting gap. Polymerase theta mostly has amino-terminal helicase domain, a carboxy-terminal polymerase domain and an intervening space region.
